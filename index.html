    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>A detailed orientated individual who enjoys diving deep into assigned tasks to perform.
        In my current position as an operations manager in a start-up E-commerce company naturally
        I need to research and dive deep in most of the tasks to understand how and what need to be done to complete them.
        I also enjoy the research and experimentation processes in coding because they give flexibility and opportunity for creativity.
        In addition, as a Project Management graduate I am highly organised, have good problem solving, time management,
        communication, and collaboration skills. In most of my jobs I stand out with the ability to collaborate with my team
        and creating a supportive environment to understand each other and learn from each other.
        I am also very patient and whenever I must train new co-worker, I give my best to prepare them and in addition
        I always pass over new knowledge and information as they come to my team.
        The reasons to want to change my career from the E-commerce to Web development are that I see coding as a skill
        that really reflects and aligns with my detailed orientated personality and the need for constant collaboration with peers,
        to learn and advance in the field. </p>
